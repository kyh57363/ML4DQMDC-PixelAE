**Tools for copying files or datasets from DAS to local**  

To be used in case remote file access does not work or is too slow, or for debugging.  
The scripts in this folder can be used to copy a single file or all files in a dataset from DAS to a specified local folder. Then, some ME's can be extracted from them and put in whatever data format is preferred, using the tools in the parent folder with local file access instead of remote file access. When done, the downloaded datasets from DAS can be removed again.
