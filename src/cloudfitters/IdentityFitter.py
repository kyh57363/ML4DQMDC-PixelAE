# **Class for using classifier scores directly as global scores** 

# Only intended for the case where only one histogram type is being considered,
# so no real fitting needs to be done.
# Note: the scores are not used as such, but are inverted.
#       this corresponds to the convention that good histograms have low scores (e.g. MSE)
#       and high probability density, whereas bad histograms have high scores 
#       and low probability density.
# Note: the inversion (see above) implies that the scores are assumed to be > 0.
#       this is true for most classifiers defined up to now, where the score is an MSE value.
